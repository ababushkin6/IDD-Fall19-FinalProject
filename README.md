### Description

The idea behind the project is the monitor the temerature inside a room using sensors as well as keeping track of the number of people in the room. This is then used to create a optimal value for the thermostat to set the temperature to. People in the room can log into a website and then enter whether they are too hot or too cold as well as what temperatures they are comfortable with.
