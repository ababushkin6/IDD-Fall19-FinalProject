## Ai.re - optimized room temperature in large spaces

### Description

The idea behind the project is the monitor the temperature inside a room using multiple temperature sensors across the room and track of the number of people going in and out of the room. This is then used to create a optimal value for the thermostat to set the temperature to. People in the room can log into a website and then enter whether they are too hot or too cold as well as what temperatures they are comfortable with.
