## Calculate optimal room temperature

Using the heat emission per person and calculate room heat emission (people x human emission + people x laptop emission)
User input: room size
Calculate optimal temperature based on this

Website shows: 
- 2-3 temp sensors individual temperature 
- combined average temperature
- people in the room (interactive: in and out)
- currently set HVAC setting for the room
