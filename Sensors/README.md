# Sensor Codes

The two types of sensors that we used are 2 ultrasonic sensors as well as two temperature sensors.

### Temperature Sensors




### Ultrasonic Sensors

The ultrasonic sensors were used to determine the personel count inside the room. Using the two ultrasonic sensors in tandem we were able to determine if someone is entering or exiting the room; in so keeping track of the number of people inside.
